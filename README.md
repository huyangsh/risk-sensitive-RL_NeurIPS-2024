This repository contains the code to reproduce the simulation results, where:
* Code for the R2PG algorithm used in the toy model can be found in `toy`.
  * Folders `agent`, `data`, `env`, `util` contain the training and testing modules.
  * Folders `log` and `plot` contain the data and utilities to reproduce the figures.
  * The root folder contains program entrances for training and testing.
* Code for the modified SDEC algorithm used for classical control tasks can be found in `control`.
